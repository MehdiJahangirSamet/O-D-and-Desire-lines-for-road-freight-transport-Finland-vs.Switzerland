# O-D-and-Desire-lines-for-road-freight-transport-Finland-vs.Switzerland
This is a part of my master thesis with the title of Electrifying road freight transport (a comparative study in Finland and Switzerland).
This repository includes two R programs for my master thesis. The first program aims to summarize the results of the BEVPO model analysis for Finland and Switzerland. The second one aims to provide O-D maps and desire lines for freight transport visualization of different truck classes.
Further detailed information is available from the full text of my MSc in the Tampere University.
